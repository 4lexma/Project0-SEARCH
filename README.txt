This is my first project in CS50. 
I have created a front-end user interface dedicated to google searches.

project0.hmtl - Main file (like the google main page)
images.html - Image search interface code
Advanced.html - Advanced search interface code
styles.css - All the css code.

Video demonstration about the functionality of the project: https://youtu.be/ub5Sm5qkpZQ
